# Memory Game


## Description

This is a memory game I created, using a starter project provided by Udacity.

## Instructions

The game is a classic timed memory game.
There are 8 pairs of cards which symbols are hidden. The player clicks one card to reveal its symbol and search for its pair among all cards.
When they found a match, the matching cards remain open. The player continues until find all pairs of cards.
The game is over when all matches have been made, and a modal pops-up to congratulate the player, provided them info about their time record and star rating.
